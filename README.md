# budget-manager
Enter your expenses, your income and watch this month budget update in a nice interface.

## the app is based on the complete JS course by Jonas Schmedtmann

I added a feature to enter expenses and income in different currencies (US dollar and GB pound are available).
The app converts the amount in euro to sum up everything.
The rate is updated thank to the api echangeratesapi.io
